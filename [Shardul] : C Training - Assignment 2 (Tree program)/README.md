1. This code creates a binary tree and calculates the height of the tree.
2. The code uses 3 files to implement this definition.
3. First file is **tree.h** which is a header file. It contains code for declaration of tree and 4 functions.
4. The functions declared are functions for creating a tree, inserting node to tree, freeing the tree and calculating tree height.
5. Second file is **tree.c** which has all definition of the 4 functions.
6. Third file is the **main.c** which is the driver code. It asks the user for inserting nodes and calculates the height of tree.
7. Download all three files in one folder and compile and run **main.c** for results.
